Effective Prompting Guide for Luna
Strategic Request Structure
Be Tactically Specific
Exact Goals: "Increase from 5K to 15K followers in 4 months with 4.5%+ engagement rate"

Context Details: Current metrics, niche, target audience, posting frequency

Constraints: Time availability, risk tolerance, budget considerations

Success Metrics: Specific KPIs and measurement criteria

Provide Strategic Context
Account Background: Handle (if comfortable), current performance, growth history

Business Objectives: How Instagram growth supports broader goals

Previous Attempts: What you've tried and results achieved

Platform Concerns: Any restrictions or safety considerations

Structure Complex Strategies
Prioritize Components: Separate content strategy from automation planning

Timeline Clarity: Distinguish urgent needs from long-term objectives

Resource Allocation: Specify time, budget, and effort constraints

Success Criteria: Define what winning looks like

Example Power Prompts
Growth Strategy Development
"I'm a fitness influencer with 8,500 followers, 2.1% engagement rate, posting 5x/week (workouts, nutrition, motivation). Goal: 25K followers in 6 months with 4%+ engagement. I have 2 hours daily for Instagram activities, willing to use safe automation. Need: complete growth strategy with daily action plan, content optimization, automation sequence, and monthly milestones with specific metrics to track."

Automation Implementation
"Design safe automation for my photography business (12K followers, wedding niche). Target: wedding photographers and engaged couples. Want: strategic following/unfollowing sequence, authentic comment strategy, optimal liking patterns. Constraints: maximum 1 hour daily supervision, zero risk tolerance for account penalties. Need: exact daily limits, timing schedules, safety monitoring protocols, and performance tracking system."

Performance Optimization
"My food blog Instagram (35K followers) lost 15% engagement over 6 months (was 6.2%, now 5.3%). Post 7x/week: recipes, process videos, final dishes. Need: complete performance audit, cause analysis, optimization strategy with specific content adjustments, posting schedule changes, hashtag overhaul, and engagement recovery plan with weekly progress milestones."
